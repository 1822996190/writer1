            <b>AcaWriter works by looking for specific hallmarks of good academic writing</b> that signal (to your
            audience, the reader) that there's a significant connection being made, or an important
            development or contrast in ideas. This helps to demonstrate your critical thinking, skill in
            argument, or development as a reflective professional.

            <b>Just give it a go with a short piece of writing</b> (your own, or perhaps an open access research
            abstract): we’re not saving any texts on this demo, so take a screenshot if you want a record of
            the output.

            <b>AcaWriter was created by</b> the <a href="https://utscic.edu.au/tools/awa/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Academic Writing Analytics</a> project, at the UTS Connected
            Intelligence Centre. Go there to learn about the ideas and tech behind the scenes, and what
            we're learning as we test it with staff and students. The software is now being shared and
            improved across universities in Australia and beyond, as part of the Higher Education Text
            Analytics open source project.
